`t` is a TODO list management software to be used on the CLI. Data is
stored in JSON format in `$HOME/.config/.TODO` and
[jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) is used to process the JSON file.

`t` is distributed under the MIT license (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)), and
aims to be as simple as possible.


Installation
------------

Copy the `t` script to a directory in your execution path.


Usage
-----

Use `t -h` for the available options.
